"""
TODO: make logging much better. 
TODO: add more information to output files. 
TODO: make infrastructure for swappability
- add other LLMs
- try other morphing techniques
- separate search more from other techniques
- make distance function more separate from LLM / make it as an independent scoring module. 
--- we can use scoring in place of a JUDGE model which can give a score based on the output
- Similarity model can be used for predetermining which outputs to check? think about how to use this method. 

Search techniques: 
- (1) GA based techniques
- (2) Gradient descent/SLS
- (3) simulated annealing
- (4) Tree based search methods
- (5) Try adding delta evaluations
- (6) multi-objective improvement vs single function improvement. 
- (7) fuzzing techniques
- (8) SLS + perturbation (iterated local search)





TODO: Secondary research objective 
Investigate what is a good method to finding out what is a good jailbreak success result
